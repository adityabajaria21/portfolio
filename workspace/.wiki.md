# Project Summary
The E-commerce Customer Analytics project is a sophisticated platform designed to provide e-commerce businesses with actionable insights through advanced data analytics. The platform focuses on enhancing marketing strategies, improving customer retention, and increasing revenue by utilizing methodologies such as Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) forecasting and customer segmentation. It features a variety of analytics functions, including predictive modeling for customer reviews and statistical analysis to assess customer satisfaction, supported by an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to ensure accurate and relevant insights.

# Project Module Description
The platform includes several key modules:
- **Customer Segmentation**: Utilizes RFM analysis and clustering to identify distinct customer segments.
- **CLV Prediction Models**: Employs advanced statistical models for forecasting customer lifetime value and assessing churn risk.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Provides real-time insights and visualizations of customer data, segmentation, and CLV predictions.
- **Executive Reporting**: Generates comprehensive reports summarizing analysis results and strategic insights.
- **Business Scenario Visualizations**: Delivers tailored visual representations for various business scenarios.
- **Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines semantic and keyword search with reranking for accurate, source-backed responses.
