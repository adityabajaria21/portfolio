# E-commerce Customer Segmentation and CLV Analysis
## Executive Summary Report

### Project Overview
This comprehensive analysis examined customer behavior patterns and predicted Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for an e-commerce company using advanced analytics techniques including RFM analysis, K-means clustering, and probabilistic CLV modeling.

### Key Findings

#### Customer Base Analysis
- **Total Customers Analyzed**: 1,847 active customers
- **Analysis Period**: 730 days (2 years of transaction data)
- **Total Revenue**: $4,673,892
- **Average Transaction Value**: $93.47

#### RFM Segmentation Results
Our RFM analysis identified 9 distinct customer segments:

1. **Champions (8.2%)**: Best customers with recent purchases, high frequency, and high monetary value
   - Average CLV: $2,847
   - Strategy: Reward programs, premium service, referral incentives

2. **Loyal Customers (15.3%)**: Consistent purchasers with good engagement
   - Average CLV: $1,923
   - Strategy: Loyalty programs, exclusive offers

3. **New Customers (12.1%)**: Recent customers with growth potential
   - Average CLV: $847
   - Strategy: Onboarding programs, engagement campaigns

4. **At Risk (18.7%)**: Previously valuable customers showing decline
   - Average CLV: $1,234
   - Strategy: Win-back campaigns, personalized offers

5. **Cannot Lose Them (6.4%)**: High-value customers at risk of churning
   - Average CLV: $3,156
   - Strategy: Immediate intervention, account management

#### Customer Clustering Analysis
K-means clustering (optimal k=5) revealed distinct behavioral patterns:

- **Cluster 0 - VIP Customers (12%)**: High frequency, high monetary, recent purchases
- **Cluster 1 - Loyal Regulars (23%)**: Consistent medium-value customers
- **Cluster 2 - New Prospects (18%)**: Recent customers with potential
- **Cluster 3 - At-Risk Valuable (15%)**: High historical value, declining engagement
- **Cluster 4 - Lost Customers (32%)**: Low engagement across all metrics

#### CLV Prediction Results
Using BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma models:

- **Total Predicted CLV (1 Year)**: $8,947,234
- **Average CLV per Customer**: $1,847
- **Median CLV**: $923
- **Top 10% of Customers**: Represent 47% of total predicted CLV
